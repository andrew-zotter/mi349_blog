<p>What is the sport golf?</p>

   <p>Author:  Andrew Zotter</p>
   

   <p> Golf is a sport that has been played for many many years. The goal of the game is to get the ball into the hole using the least ammount of hits from the club as you can. There are many different types of clubs to use during the game. For long distance hitting, the driver club will be the best option. For mid range hitting, you would want to use an iron club, when you are on the green, the putter is the best option.</p>
